### **Project Title**
**Ecommerce Sales Dashboard**

## **Project Overview**
This project involves creating an interactive sales dashboard to analyze ecommerce data. The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales, profit, and quantity sold, and helps visualize trends across different categories, sub-categories, and regions. The primary tool used is **Power BI**.

## **Dashboard Screenshots**
Here are a few screenshots of the completed dashboard to showcase its design and features.
